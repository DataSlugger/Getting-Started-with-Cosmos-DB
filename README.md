# Using Cosmos DB
Sample code and documentation about how to properly use Cosmos DB in your application - Information that I would have loved to have before designing my first solutions using CosmosDB.

## Introduction
This tutorial focuses mainly on the things you need to know before building your application with Cosmos DB, the things that can be quite hard if not impossible to change once you've deployed your solution.

If you are not familiar with Cosmos DB, you should first read this [overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction).

## Tutorial Structure
There are several parts to this tutorial. Each part focuses on a particular subject. The contents of each part is stored in their own branch, so you can easily compare the differences from one part to another.

The next part always contains everything from the previous part, and all parts are merged to the `master` branch. Each part also has their own readme file, which you can find below.

- [Part 1](Part01-readme.md): Setting up your environment.
- [Part 2](Part02-readme.md): Creating a Cosmos DB database.
- [Part 3](Part03-readme.md): Designing a data model.
